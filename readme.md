# Bachelor Loop

Bachelor loop is a road located in Creede Colorado. It goes up the mountain from the town of Creede to the ghost town of Bachelor. Bachelor was a town that formed around the Bachelor mine around 1890 in Colorado's last great silver boom. The town was abandoned before the turn of the centurey when the Silver Panic hit Colorado in full force.

Bachelor Loop is also the name of this project. This project is a sort of proving ground for ideas. The end goal is a modular framework. Feel free to follow along.
