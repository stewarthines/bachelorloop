# Bachelor Loop

Bachelor loop is a road located in Creede Colorado. It goes up the mountain from the town of Creede to the ghost town of Bachelor. Bachelor was a town that formed around the Bachelor mine around 1890 in Colorado's last great silver boom. The town was abandoned before the turn of the centurey when the Silver Panic hit Colorado in full force.

Bachelor Loop is also the name of this project. This project is a sort of proving ground for ideas. The end goal is a modular framework. Feel free to follow along.

## What's the plan man?

I plan on using Bachelor Loop as a place to develop a frame work. I'm going to add a list of things to do! I'm following the [OCSS by Nicole Sullivan](http://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/object-oriented-css) and I'm learning from frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, but especially [Kraken](https://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/) by @cferdinandi. I've learned a ton from his framework. I'm also following along with [Atomic Design.](http://demo.patternlab.io/) Kind of sounds like I'm name-dropping huh?

- [ ] A mobile-first, flexbox based grid (see the [Kraken Grid](https://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/components.html#the-grid) & [Solved by Flexbox](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/grids/))
- [ ] My own CSS reset. So I learn what the heck they are and what they are doing. Also, so I have full control.
- [ ] A component library. Not sure 100% what this looks like yet. I'll probably follow one of the above mentioned frame works.

It's time to go home.
