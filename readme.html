<h1 id="bachelor-loop">Bachelor Loop</h1>
<p>Bachelor loop is a road located in Creede Colorado. It goes up the mountain from the town of Creede to the ghost town of Bachelor. Bachelor was a town that formed around the Bachelor mine around 1890 in Colorado&#39;s last great silver boom. The town was abandoned before the turn of the centurey when the Silver Panic hit Colorado in full force.</p>
<p>Bachelor Loop is also the name of this project. This project is a sort of proving ground for ideas. The end goal is a modular framework. Feel free to follow along.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-the-plan-man-">What&#39;s the plan man?</h2>
<p>I plan on using Bachelor Loop as a place to develop a frame work. I&#39;m going to add a list of things to do! I&#39;m following the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/object-oriented-css">OCSS by Nicole Sullivan</a> and I&#39;m learning from frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, but especially <a href="https://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/">Kraken</a> by @cferdinandi. I&#39;ve learned a ton from his framework. I&#39;m also following along with <a href="http://demo.patternlab.io/">Atomic Design.</a> Kind of sounds like I&#39;m name-dropping huh?</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] A mobile-first, flexbox based grid (see the <a href="https://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/components.html#the-grid">Kraken Grid</a> &amp; <a href="https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/grids/">Solved by Flexbox</a>)</li>
<li>[ ] My own CSS reset. So I learn what the heck they are and what they are doing. Also, so I have full control.</li>
<li>[ ] A component library. Not sure 100% what this looks like yet. I&#39;ll probably follow one of the above mentioned frame works.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s time to go home.</p>
